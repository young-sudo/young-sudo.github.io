# Machine Leaning

* Deep Learning fundamentals
    * Gradient descent and backpropagation
    * CNNs (with Adversarial Training and Sparse TopK)
    * Transformers (Attention and Differential Attention)
    * Reinforcement learning - PPO and RND

* Multi-omic models
* Unsupervised learning in Biomedical imaging (Fundus glaucoma VAE)
* Microscopy cell image segmentation (UNet)

* Drug Design = Protein modeling (Alphafold2) + Amino acid-based LLMs (ProtGPT2)

(work-in-progress)
