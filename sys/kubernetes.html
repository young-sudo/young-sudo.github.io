<p style="text-align: justify;">
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to deploy, scale, and manage applications across clusters of machines. 
It abstracts infrastructure into a unified API, enabling automated scheduling, rolling updates, self-healing workloads, service discovery, and horizontal scaling. 
Because it integrates deeply with cloud-native tooling and managed services (EKS, GKE, AKS), Kubernetes has become the backbone of modern distributed systems and large-scale workflow infrastructure.

<h4>Quick Practical Guide</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Define workloads declaratively using YAML manifests (Pods, Deployments, Services, Jobs).</li>
  <li>Use container images (Docker/Apptainer-derived) as the execution units within the cluster.</li>
  <li>Leverage managed cloud offerings (EKS/GKE/AKS) for simplified cluster lifecycle management.</li>
  <li>Scale pipelines or services horizontally using autoscaling and node pools.</li>
  <li>Integrate workflow engines (Nextflow with k8s executor) for large distributed bioinformatics workloads.</li>
</ul>
